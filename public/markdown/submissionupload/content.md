## Aspera or FTP file upload

Once your submission files have been prepared using the PRIDE Submission Tool, files can be uploaded using Aspera or FTP. When preparing your dataset please be sure to unambiguously assign a unique file name to all of your files. Please also upload the submission summary file and the checksum file (both generated by PX tool) into the same folder.

First, ask PRIDE support (at pride-support@ebi.ac.uk) for a target directory and a password. The PRIDE curators will specify a target directory for you, see <name-oftarget-dir-specified-by-PRIDE> in the following commands, and you will be provided with this information. Please E-mail us once your upload has been successfully finished.

## FTP 

PRIDE team will setup a directory on our private FTP server for you to manually upload your files to. Please see the details below:

FTP details:

- FTP server: ftp-private.ebi.ac.uk
- User name : pride-drop-006
- Password : {PRIDE team will send the password by email}
- directory : {this will also be mentioned in the email from PRIDE team}

For security reasons, we do not allow directory listings at the top level so you will need to manually navigate to the proper directory, either by typing the command (if using a command-line): `cd <Directory Name>`
or by the corresponding "go to directory" option (of whatever graphical tool you are using): `/<Directory Name>`

Concerning FTP client programs, we recommend using WinSCP (Windows only) or FileZilla (all OS). You can download one of them from these links:
- WinSCP : http://winscp.net/eng/download.php
- FileZilla: http://filezilla-project.org/download.php

Once connected to the FTP and in your target directory, upload your files normally, and let me know when the transfer has been completed.
    
### Using an FTP client

e.g. Filezilla

Use the following connection details (File=> Site Manager) and add your submission account username and password :

![FTP upload](../markdown/submissionupload/files/filezilla.png)

Select the files you wish to upload, then right click mouse, and select 'upload'.


## Aspera

Download Aspera desktop client from [here](https://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Other%20software&product=ibm/Other%20software/IBM%20Aspera%20Desktop%20Client&release=All&platform=All&function=all).

If the above link doesn't work, try to navigate from [here](https://www.ibm.com/products/aspera/downloads) and look for 'IBM Aspera Desktop Client'.

Aspera connection details:
- Host/Server: ftp-private.ebi.ac.uk
- User: pride-drop-006
- Password : {PRIDE team will send the password by email}
- Target directory : {this will also be mentioned in the email from PRIDE team}

### Usage
Using the Aspera desktop client is very straight forward like Filezilla or WinSCP FTP clients mentioned in the previous section but if further help is needed, refer to the [official documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/asdc)
