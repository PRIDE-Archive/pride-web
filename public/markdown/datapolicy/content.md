## PRIDE data policy
Version 1.0 (May 2022)

### General guidelines for submitted datasets

Submitters of proteomics datasets to the PRIDE database should be aware of the following aspects of our data policy.

A) General statements

- The PRIDE database (as part of ProteomeXchange, and also as an EMBL-EBI resource) has a uniform policy of free and unrestricted access to all the datasets deposited once they are released to the public.

- **Dataset Licenses**: The terms of the Creative Commons Public Domain (CC0) License apply to all PRIDE datasets submitted from June 2018. In this case, all submitters have specifically agreed to these terms during the submission process. All submitted datasets before that date (June 2018) are subject to the EBI terms of use (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/terms-of-use).

- Data availability: For how long will PRIDE datasets remain publicly available? All public datasets will remain permanently accessible to the community for the foreseeable future as part of the scientific record.

B) Private datasets

All datasets submitted to PRIDE are private by default. Submitters (both the researcher who performed the submission and the Principal Investigator) can access their own private datasets by using their PRIDE  username and password. Additionally, a username and password are provided to facilitate access for journal editors and reviewers during the manuscript review process.

Submitted datasets will remain private until:

- The submitter requests that it  is released to the public. This can be done at any point. However, it is recommended that datasets are released when it is expected that they will not change any longer  (e.g. at the moment of publication of the corresponding manuscript). See details below about our policy for public datasets.

- Other users can request the publication of a dataset when the corresponding publication is available. Pre-prints are not considered to be publications in this context.

- PRIDE will automatically release datasets to the public upon notification of the  corresponding publication (automatically, via e.g. information sent by the journal or available in EuropePMC).

- Private datasets can be modified (e.g. files can be added or removed from the datasets and/or metadata can be updated) before they are released to the public.

- **Release/Publication date**: Datasets can remain private for up to 2 years after being submitted. If applicable, after this period, submitters will need to provide a tentative date for the release of a given dataset. Submitters will be able to extend this date once the deadline is approaching. Reminders about dataset release dates will be sent to submitters 60, 30, and 7 days before the set release date. PRIDE cannot store datasets that remain private forever.

**Note**: The release date can be changed using an access control page and the submitter credentials. If submitters do not extend the release date, the dataset will be released to the public on the date that was previously selected.

C) Publicly available datasets

- **Update of public datasets**: Datasets that have been released to the public should not be modified unless it is really unavoidable, based on exceptional reasons. Submitters should make sure that the data included in a dataset is consistent, valuable, and correct before it is released to the public. Once a dataset has been released, its availability is then managed by PRIDE and submitters must contact the team in the event of any issues at that point.

- Therefore, corrections in the metadata (including e.g. the title and abstract) must be justified and can be requested to the PRIDE team.

- Removal of  public datasets. Submitters should contact the PRIDE team to remove a dataset from the resource, which should only happen in very exceptional circumstances:
  - Submitters realize that the dataset is incorrect, with no immediate opportunity to correct it.
  - Data is found to have been submitted to PRIDE without the permission of the rightful owner. This is expected to be extremely rare and requires formal institutional contact with the submitting institution.
  - Formal retraction of the corresponding publication.
  - In any case, once a  dataset has been distributed as public, PRIDE cannot exercise any control on the downstream use of the data by third parties, even if it is subsequently removed from PRIDE.

**Note**: Datasets from PRIDE are automatically downloaded and often reused, and the corresponding metadata is synchronized between  several  resources including ProteomeXchange partners (e.g. MassIVE, PeptideAtlas), OmicsDI, and others.

- **Pre-prints policy**. By default, we do not encourage the public release of datasets available in pre-print manuscripts until the final publication is accepted. Datasets in this situation can often be extensively modified during the peer-review review process, and PRIDE does not have the storage capacity to keep track of all the versions of a given dataset. As mentioned above, changes to published datasets should only happen in exceptional circumstances.

D) Sensitive datasets

PRIDE (as part of ProteomeXchange) supports fully open data. At the moment, PRIDE  cannot support appropriately datasets that contain sensitive human data, meaning all those datasets that for legal reasons cannot be made publicly available without further restrictions (e.g. datasets that must be made available under controlled-access). Submitters wanting to submit this type of dataset are recommended to find an alternative to PRIDE.

The current state of the art of data management practices for this type of proteomics dataset is described in detail in the following manuscript (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S153594762100044X).


### Additional data generated by PRIDE for the submitted datasets

During the submission and post-submission steps, the PRIDE team can attach to a dataset a set of additional files to help the users to understand, retrieve and reuse them. These files do not modify in any way the original submitted files, but can increase the reusability of the deposited datasets.

Some examples of additional files are:

- SDRF-Proteomics files  (Sample and Data Relationship Files), which contain additional annotations, including the mapping between the samples analyzed and the data files deposited. These files are often produced by third parties (either members of the PRIDE team or by other members of the community). More information about SDRF-Proteomics files and how they are handled by PRIDE is available in this publication (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26111-3).
- mzTab files exported from mzIdentML files. Some users prefer to read tab-delimited file formats instead of XML-based files. The PRIDE database can convert automatically mzIdentML files into mzTab.

### Data reuse guidelines

Following good scientific practices, users that reuse the deposited datasets in PRIDE should give appropriate credit to the original authors/submitters by citing the original dataset or the publication including  the dataset.
