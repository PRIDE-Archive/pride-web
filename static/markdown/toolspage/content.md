## PRIDE Submission Tool 

The [PRIDE Submission Tool](/markdownpage/pridesubmissiontool) is the main tool used to submit the proteomics experiment to [PRIDE Archive](wwww.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/). This tool has been implemented as a Wizard, guiding the submitter trough a set of simple steps to build the final submission.
